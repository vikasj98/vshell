This is my attempt to implement a basic linux shell in C
This project is heavily inspired by Stephen Brennan's project located at 
https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/

Lets see how far I can go


16 Oct 2019

The current implementation does the following

Enters an infinite loop and reads one command at a time
command and arguments should be space separated.
Forks a new child prcess for the command.
A few shell built ins are available. namely cd, exit and help



Build instructions
The project comes with a Makefile. 

make
builds the project in the current directory.

Run the shell
./vshell
Enter help to get an onscreen help.

The shell won't run any command as superuser because it thinks sudo is an order.
Use please instead of sudo to request.
